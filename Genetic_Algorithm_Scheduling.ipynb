    "## Hard Constraint Evaluation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "This function evaluates a timetable to check for violations of hard constraints — rules that must not be broken for the schedule to be valid. It counts different types of violations and prints a summary, helping us understand where the schedule fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters:\n",
    "- **`timetable`:** A dictionary where each timeslot contains rooms and the activities scheduled in them.\n",
    "- **`activities_dict`:** A dictionary of all activities, indexed by activity ID.\n",
    "- **`groups_dict`:** A dictionary of student groups, including their sizes.\n",
    "- **`spaces_dict`:** A dictionary of rooms, including their capacities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the function checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vacant Rooms:**  \n",
    "   If a room is left empty in a timeslot, it’s counted as a vacant room. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lecturer Conflicts:**  \n",
    "   If the same lecturer is assigned to more than one activity in the same timeslot, that counts as a conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Student Group Conflicts:**  \n",
    "   If a student group is scheduled for multiple activities in the same timeslot, it creates a conflict. The function uses set intersections to catch these overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Room Capacity Violations:**  \n",
    "   The function checks if the total number of students in an activity exceeds the room’s capacity. If it does, that counts as a violation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Unassigned Activities:**  \n",
    "   The function also counts how many activities were never assigned to any room or timeslot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The output:  \n",
    "After checking all the constraints, the function prints a summary:  \n",
    "- **Vacant Rooms Count** — how many rooms were left empty.  \n",
    "- **Lecturer Conflict Violations** — how many times lecturers were double-booked.  \n",
    "- **Student Group Conflict Violations** — how many times student groups were double-booked.  \n",
    "- **Room Capacity Violations** — how many times room size was insufficient for the assigned activity.  \n",
    "- **Unassigned Activity Violations** — how many activities weren’t placed in the timetable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it adds up all the violations to give a **total hard constraint violation score**. This score gives a quick sense of how well the timetable satisfies the strictest rules. Lower scores are better, meaning fewer conflicts and a more feasible schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is essential for checking the raw feasibility of a schedule before worrying about things like preferences or soft constraints. \n"

    "## Soft Constraint Evaluation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "This function evaluates the **soft constraints** of a timetable — factors that influence schedule quality but can be compromised if necessary. It measures aspects like student and lecturer fatigue, idle time, spread of lectures, and lecturer workload balance. The function then computes an overall score to help us understand how well the schedule performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters:\n",
    "- **`schedule`:** A dictionary representing the scheduled activities, organized by time slots and room assignments.\n",
    "- **`groups_dict`:** A dictionary containing student group details (e.g., group size).\n",
    "- **`lecturers_dict`:** A dictionary containing lecturer details.\n",
    "- **`slots`:** An ordered list of available time slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the function checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Student Metrics:**  \n",
    "   - **Fatigue:** Number of lectures attended.  \n",
    "   - **Idle Time:** Gaps between lectures within the same day.  \n",
    "   - **Lecture Spread:** Distribution of lectures across slots (more spread = more scattered, less compact).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lecturer Metrics:**  \n",
    "   - **Fatigue:** Number of lectures conducted.  \n",
    "   - **Idle Time:** Gaps between lectures.  \n",
    "   - **Lecture Spread:** How scattered the lectures are across the slots.  \n",
    "   - **Workload Balance:** Variance in workload across lecturers (lower variance = better balance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the function works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It loops through each timeslot and room to gather relevant data on activities.  \n",
    "- It updates fatigue, spread, and workload metrics directly during this loop.  \n",
    "- It calculates idle time by checking gaps between consecutive lectures.  \n",
    "- It normalizes all metrics for fair comparison and calculates workload balance using variance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scoring the constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function prints individual scores for:  \n",
    "- **Student Fatigue Factor**  \n",
    "- **Student Idle Time Factor**  \n",
    "- **Student Lecture Spread Factor**  \n",
    "- **Lecturer Fatigue Factor**  \n",
    "- **Lecturer Idle Time Factor**  \n",
    "- **Lecturer Lecture Spread Factor**  \n",
    "- **Lecturer Workload Balance Factor**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it computes a **weighted final score**. Higher scores indicate better schedule quality, with a balance between minimizing fatigue, idle time, and spread, while maximizing workload balance for lecturers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights reflect the relative importance of each factor, but these can be adjusted as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is invaluable for refining a feasible schedule into an optimized one that enhances the well-being of both students and lecturers.\n"
